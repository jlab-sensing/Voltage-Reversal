# Voltage-Reversal
This is an ongoing research area on voltage reversal. A reported phenomenon in microbial fuel cells.

Voltage reversal is when one microbial fuel cell (MFC) in series reverses polarity. Causing a subsequent loss of power in the whole circuit, and degredation
of the MFCs themselves.
